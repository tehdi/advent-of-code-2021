Part 1
Find the first illegal character in each corrupted line of the navigation subsystem
What is the total syntax error score for those errors?

Every chunk must open and close with one of four legal pairs of matching characters:
    If a chunk opens with (, it must close with ).
    If a chunk opens with [, it must close with ].
    If a chunk opens with {, it must close with }.
    If a chunk opens with <, it must close with >.
chunks contain zero or more other chunks
Adjacent chunks are not separated by any delimiter
Some lines are incomplete, but others are corrupted
A corrupted line is one where a chunk closes with the wrong character

eg: {([(<{}[<>[]}>{[]{[(<()>

To calculate the syntax error score for a line, take the first illegal character on the line and look it up in the following table:
    ): 3 points
    ]: 57 points
    }: 1197 points
    >: 25137 points

I could do this by going over the line multiple times
each time removing adjacent matching open-close pairs
and calling it corrupted once I find an adjacent open-close non-pair
using the example above, that would be:
{([(<{}[<>[]}>{[]{[(<()>
     ^^ ^^^^   ^^    ^^
{([(<[}>{{[(<>
     !!     ^^

but what this problem really wants is a stack. which Go doesn't have built in but don't worry! I found one.
if you get to the end of the line without any problems, but you have characters left on the stack:
    that's an incomplete line that we don't care about for this part
    but I bet we will in Part 2


Part 2
Find the completion string for each incomplete line, score the completion strings, and sort the scores.
What is the middle score? (there will always be an odd number of scores to consider)

Start with a total score of 0
for each character, multiply the total score by 5 and then increase the total score by the point value given for the character in the following table:
    ): 1 point
    ]: 2 points
    }: 3 points
    >: 4 points
