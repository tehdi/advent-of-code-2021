forward X increases the horizontal position by X units.
down X increases the depth by X units.
up X decreases the depth by X units.

Your horizontal position and depth both start at 0

Calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course.
What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?

Part 2
down X increases your aim by X units.
up X decreases your aim by X units.
forward X does two things:
    It increases your horizontal position by X units.
    It increases your depth by your aim multiplied by X.

What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?
