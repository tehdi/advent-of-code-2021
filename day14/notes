Part 1

Apply 10 steps of pair insertion to the polymer template and find the most and least common elements in the result.
What do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract the quantity of the least common element?

The first line is the polymer template. All the other lines are the pair insertion rules
A rule like AB -> C means that when elements A and B are immediately adjacent, element C should be inserted between them.
** These insertions all happen simultaneously. **
Generated pairs in any given step don't count toward this step's insertions, because they haven't happened yet

Example:
    NNCB

    CH -> B
    HH -> N
    CB -> H
    NH -> C
    HB -> C
    HC -> B
    HN -> C
    NN -> C
    BH -> H
    NC -> B
    NB -> B
    BN -> B
    BB -> N
    BC -> B
    CC -> N
    CN -> C

Pairs in the template:
    NN
    NC
    CB

Matching rules:
    NN -> C
    NC -> B
    CB -> H

Result after 1 step:
    NCNBCHB


Let's manually build step 2 to make sure we understand.
Start: NCNBCHB
Pairs:
    NC: NC -> B
    CN: CN -> C
    NB: NB -> B
    BC: BC -> B
    CH: CH -> B
    HB: HB -> C
Result: NBCCNBBBCBHCB
Expected result: NBCCNBBBCBHCB
Yay I got it right!


My input starts with a much longer template: SNVVKOBFKOPBFFFCPBSF
And I have like 100 pair insertion rules
So maybe don't calculate 10 steps manually
