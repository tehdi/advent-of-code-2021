Part 1
a low point is a point on the grid that's a lower number than any adjacent points
adjacent points are up, down, left, and right
unless it's a side or corner in which case one or two of those will be missing
the risk level of a low point is 1 plus its height
What is the sum of the risk levels of all low points on your heightmap?

can I just use a 2d array for this one?
compare each value to the value at adjacent points
easy enough
