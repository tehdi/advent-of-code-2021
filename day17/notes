The probe's x,y position starts at 0,0
The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any integer velocity in the x (forward) and y (upward, or downward if negative) directions
On each step, these changes occur in the following order:
    - x pos += x velocity
    - y pos += y velocity
    - x velocity moves 1 toward 0
    - y velocity -= 1

the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a target area after any step

If you're going to fire a highly scientific probe out of a super cool probe launcher, you might as well do it with style. How high can you make the probe go while still reaching the target area?

Notes notes notes
x and y movement are independent. there is no way for x movement to modify a y, and vice versa
x always eventually stops. once it stops, it spends infinity steps at that stopping point
y never stops, but it does peak

y movement is surprisingly easy to calculate:
- what goes up at a starting speed, comes back down at that speed. just like real gravity
so if my target is -100 from my current position, the max upward speed I can launch is +99
- lauch at +99 -> will be going -99 when it passes me on the way down
- accelerates -1 per step = the next step will be from me at 0 to (me-100)
yay for finding upper bounds to launch speeds!

Part 1
Find the initial velocity that causes the probe to reach the highest y position and still eventually be within the target area after any step. What is the highest y position it reaches on this trajectory?

Part 2
How many distinct initial velocity values cause the probe to be within the target area after any step?
