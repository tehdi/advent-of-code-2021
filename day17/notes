The probe's x,y position starts at 0,0
The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any integer velocity in the x (forward) and y (upward, or downward if negative) directions
On each step, these changes occur in the following order:
    - x pos += x velocity
    - y pos += y velocity
    - x velocity moves 1 toward 0
    - y velocity -= 1

the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a target area after any step

If you're going to fire a highly scientific probe out of a super cool probe launcher, you might as well do it with style. How high can you make the probe go while still reaching the target area?

Part 1
Find the initial velocity that causes the probe to reach the highest y position and still eventually be within the target area after any step. What is the highest y position it reaches on this trajectory?

Part 2
How many distinct initial velocity values cause the probe to be within the target area after any step?
