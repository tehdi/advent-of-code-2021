Part 1
Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format x1,y1 -> x2,y2
x1,y1 are the coordinates of one end the line segment
x2,y2 are the coordinates of the other end
These line segments include the points at both ends.
Consider only horizontal and vertical lines (lines where either x1 = x2 or y1 = y2).
At how many points do at least two lines overlap?

the largest number in my input is 990

input example: 498,436 -> 498,932


Part 2
now add in diagonals and answer the same question about line overlaps

how to decide if two points form a diagonal line?
    I'm gonna go with: abs(x1-x2) == abs(y1-y2)
