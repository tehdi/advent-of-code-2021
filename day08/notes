Part 1
the four-digit seven-segment displays in your submarine are malfunctioning
the signals which control the segments have been mixed up
the wires are randomly connected to segments
each 4-digit display is broken in a different way, but it's consistent within a display

the segments are identified by letters like this:
  0:      1:      2:      3:      4:
 aaaa    ....    aaaa    aaaa    ....
b    c  .    c  .    c  .    c  b    c
b    c  .    c  .    c  .    c  b    c
 ....    ....    dddd    dddd    dddd
e    f  .    f  e    .  .    f  .    f
e    f  .    f  e    .  .    f  .    f
 gggg    ....    gggg    gggg    ....

  5:      6:      7:      8:      9:
 aaaa    aaaa    aaaa    aaaa    aaaa
b    .  b    .  .    c  b    c  b    c
b    .  b    .  .    c  b    c  b    c
 dddd    dddd    ....    dddd    dddd
.    f  e    f  .    f  e    f  .    f
.    f  e    f  .    f  e    f  .    f
 gggg    gggg    ....    gggg    gggg

the digits 1, 4, 7, and 8 are easy because they each use a unique number of segments, so part 1 is to count those
0: 6 -> shared with 6, 9
1: 2 -> unique
2: 5 -> shared with 3, 5
3: 5 -> shared with 2, 5
4: 4 -> unique
5: 5 -> shared with 2, 3
6: 6 -> shared with 0, 9
7: 3 -> unique
8: 7 -> unique
9: 6 -> shared with 0, 6

input:
    each line has all ten unique signal patterns for a single four digit output value, followed by a single four digit output value
    the code may be different per line
example:     acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab | cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf
explanation: the ten unique observed patterns                           | the display
