Part 1
How many paths through this cave system are there that visit small caves at most once?

find all the paths from <start> to <end>
<BIG> caves (uppercase letters) can be visited multiple times
<small> caves (lowercase letters) can only be visited a maximum of once

example input:
    start-A
    start-b
    A-c
    A-b
    b-d
    A-end
    b-end

drawn out:
    start
    /   \
c--A-----b--d
    \   /
     end

available paths:
    start,A,b,A,c,A,end
    start,A,b,A,end
    start,A,b,end
    start,A,c,A,b,A,end
    start,A,c,A,b,end
    start,A,c,A,end
    start,A,end
    start,b,A,c,A,end
    start,b,A,end
    start,b,end

d is never visited, because that would mean visiting b at least twice, which isn't allowed

if a small cave has only one connection, and it's to another small cave, that first small cave is not accessible
    in my input, all of my small caves are connected to at least one large cave
if a large cave connects to another large cave, you can go back and forth forever
    I don't have any of these connections in my input
