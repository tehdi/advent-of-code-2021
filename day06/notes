Part 1
each lanternfish creates a new lanternfish once every 7 days
this process isn't necessarily synchronized between every lanternfish
you can model each fish as a single number that represents the number of days until it creates a new lanternfish
a new lanternfish would surely need slightly longer before it's capable of producing more lanternfish: two more days for its first cycle
A lanternfish that creates a new fish resets its timer to 6, not 7 (because 0 is included as a valid timer value)
The new lanternfish starts with an internal timer of 8 and does not start counting down until the next day.
Each day, a 0 becomes a 6 and adds a new 8 to the end of the list, while each other number decreases by 1 if it was present at the start of the day.

How many lanternfish would there be after 80 days?


Part 2
After 256 days?
