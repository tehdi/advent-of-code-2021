Part 1
You have a sheet of transparent paper with dots on it
the dots' locations are represented by 0-indexed x,y pairs where 0,0 is the top left corner
you need to fold the paper along the given x or y line(s)
dots will never appear exactly on a fold line

How many dots are visible after completing just the first fold instruction on your transparent paper?

my first fold instruction is:
fold along x=655

I think I can cheat part 1 by plotting with that first fold already in mind instead of transforming after the fact
this fold will keep all y values the same but transform any x values larger than the fold line
    eg. any dots on x=800=(655+145) will become x=(655-145)=510 instead
x => 655-abs(655-x)
