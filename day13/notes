Part 1
You have a sheet of transparent paper with dots on it
the dots' locations are represented by 0-indexed x,y pairs where 0,0 is the top left corner
you need to fold the paper along the given x or y line(s)
dots will never appear exactly on a fold line

How many dots are visible after completing just the first fold instruction on your transparent paper?

my first fold instruction is:
fold along x=655

I think I can cheat part 1 by plotting with that first fold already in mind instead of transforming after the fact
this fold will keep all y values the same but transform any x values larger than the fold line
    eg. any dots on x=800=(655+145) will become x=(655-145)=510 instead
x => 655-abs(655-x)


Part 2
Finish folding the transparent paper according to the instructions. The manual says the code is always eight capital letters.
What code do you use to activate the infrared thermal imaging camera system?

I will continue cheating. These are all my folds, in order:
fold along x=655
fold along y=447
fold along x=327
fold along y=223
fold along x=163
fold along y=111
fold along x=81
fold along y=55
fold along x=40
fold along y=27
fold along y=13
fold along y=6

Sorted by x/y but otherwise still in order:
fold along x=655
fold along x=327
fold along x=163
fold along x=81
fold along x=40

fold along y=447
fold along y=223
fold along y=111
fold along y=55
fold along y=27
fold along y=13
fold along y=6
