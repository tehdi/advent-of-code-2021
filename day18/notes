Snailfish numbers
every snailfish number is a pair: an ordered list of two elements
Each element of the pair can be either a regular number or another pair.

To add two snailfish numbers, form a pair from the left and right parameters of the addition operator.
For example, [1,2] + [[3,4],5] becomes [[1,2],[[3,4],5]].

snailfish numbers must always be reduced
repeatedly do the first action in this list that applies to the snailfish number, until no action applies:
    1: If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes (see below)
    2: If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits (see below)
after any action, return to the top of the list. always look for an explosion before you look for a split

The magnitude of a pair is 3 times the magnitude of its left element plus 2 times the magnitude of its right element. The magnitude of a regular number is just that number. Magnitude calculations are recursive: the magnitude of [[9,1],[1,9]] is:
      3*((3*9) + (2*1)) + 2*((3*1)+(2*9))
    = 3*(27+2) + 2*(3+18)
    = 3*29 + 2*21
    = 87 + 42
    = 129

Exploding
Exploding pairs will always consist of two regular numbers.
the pair's left value is added to the first regular number to the left of the exploding pair (if any)
the pair's right value is added to the first regular number to the right of the exploding pair (if any)
Then, the entire exploding pair is replaced with the regular number 0.
[[6,[5,[4,[3,2]]]],1] => [[6,[5,[7,0]]],3].
        ^<<^ ^>>>>>^

Splitting
replace it with a pair
the left element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded down
the right element of the pair should be the regular number divided by two and rounded up
10 => [5,5], 11 => [5,6]


Example
            [[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]] + [1,1]
add:        [[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
explode?         ^ ^
            [[[[0,7],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]
explode?                     ^ ^
            [[[[0,7],4],[15,[0,13]]],[1,1]]
explode?    no
split?                   ^^
            [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,13]]],[1,1]]
explode?    no
split?                            ^^
            [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[0,[6,7]]]],[1,1]]
explode?                           ^ ^
            [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]]
explode?    no
split?      no
final sum   [[[[0,7],4],[[7,8],[6,0]]],[8,1]]


Part 1
Add up all of the snailfish numbers in the order they appear (always reducing fully before adding the next number). What is the magnitude of the final sum?

Part 2
What is the largest magnitude of any sum of two different snailfish numbers from the homework assignment?
Note that snailfish addition is not commutative - that is, x + y and y + x can produce different results.
